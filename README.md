## Technologies Used
 JavaSE 21
 	Reading into a data from a text file into a collection
    Abstract classes
    Interfaces
    Collections
 Eclipse IDE

 ## Lessons Learned
  While only one abstract class can be directly inherited, multiple interfaces can be implemented by a class.
  Abstract classes can extend and be extended by other abstract classes.
  Exception handling with try-catch.
  Identifying members of various classes with enhanced for loops to iterate through a collection using the instanceof operator.
  UML class diagrams.
